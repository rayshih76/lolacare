### Breakfast

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We need to make sure Lola gets her nutricient from this meal.
However, breakfast for Lola could be tricky and complicated. Her stomach is the most sensitive in the morning.
We need to make sure she eats her medicine and food. Here are the steps:

1. Take one spoon full of chicken from the container.

2. Put the chicken in the bowl. add a little bit of water, just enough to make the chicken moist.
