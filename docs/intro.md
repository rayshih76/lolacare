## How to feed

### Breakfast

Time: Around 7am
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We need to make sure Lola gets her nutricient from this meal.
However, breakfast for Lola could be tricky and complicated. Her stomach is the most sensitive in the morning.
We need to make sure she eats her medicine and food.
:::warning
Sometimes Lola has stomach problem in the morning, you can hear her stomach growling, and she won't be able to eat.
If that happens, try to hand feed her tiny chicken pieces slowly. Her stomach should go back to normal afterward.
:::

Here are the steps:

1. Take one teaspoon of chicken from the container. Warm it up in the microwave for 7~8 seconds
   :::tip
   Add little bit of water in the chicken before microwave it to keep it moist

4. Make sure she has fresh water in her water bowl.

## Lunch & Dinner

Time: Aroung 12pm for lunch. 6pm for dinner.
Lunch and dinner are easier than breakfast. Or are they?
Here are the steps:

## Desert

Who doesn't love desert after meals? So does Lola!
Lola always up for some blueberries after each meal.
So please feed her 3 to 4 blueberries after breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Please also feed her some blueberries in the evening to prevent the stomach problem in the next morning.
YOu are also welcome to feed her treats every now and then if she likes it.
