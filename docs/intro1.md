Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We need to make sure Lola gets her nutricient from this meal.
However, breakfast for Lola could be tricky and complicated. Her stomach is the most sensitive in the morning.
We need to make sure she eats her medicine and food.

Sometimes Lola has stomach problem in the morning, you can hear her stomach growling, and she won't be able to eat.
If that happens, try to hand feed her tiny chicken pieces slowly. Her stomach should go back to normal afterward.

## Desert

Who doesn't love desert after meals? So does Lola!
Lola always up for some blueberries after each meal.
So please feed her 3 to 4 blueberries after breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Please also feed her some blueberries in the evening to prevent the stomach problem in the next morning.
You are also welcome to feed her treats every now and then if she likes it.
